**VIT HACK 2ND WINNER IN MOBILITY AND AUTOMATION WITH MOVEL AI AS THE CASE PARTNER**

## Description
Using ROS, turtlebot simulation and state of art voice recognition and Natural Language Processing capabilities we have created and implemented a stack which can recognise the text from the speech and do a intent classification,to give commands to our robot. A small submap of the destination room is displayed and then the user can pinpoint a desired location in the room where robot is expected to reach.The robot then intelligently plans the path, with the help of advanced path planning navigates to the desired location.
